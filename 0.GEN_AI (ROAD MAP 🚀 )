🎯 Gen AI Roadmap for Students & Freshers & Experience (IT Domain)

📍 Stage 1: Foundation (Weeks 1–2)
🔹 Goal: Understand the basics of AI and Gen AI.
What is AI vs. Gen AI


AI: Teaches machines to think and make decisions.


Gen AI: Makes new content — text, images, code, music, etc.


Famous Gen AI Tools


ChatGPT (Text)


Midjourney, DALL·E (Image)


GitHub Copilot (Code)


Types of Content Gen AI Creates


Text, Images, Audio, Video, Code



📍 Stage 2: Learn Basic Technical Skills (Weeks 3–5)
🔹 Goal: Be comfortable with the building blocks used by Gen AI tools.
Python Programming


Why: Most Gen AI models and tools use Python.


Topics: Variables, Loops, Functions, Libraries (like requests, openai, gradio)


Git & GitHub


Why: For collaboration and accessing AI model repositories.


Learn: Push, Pull, Fork, Clone


Basic APIs


Understand how to use AI tools via API (like OpenAI API)



📍 Stage 3: Dive into Gen AI Concepts (Weeks 6–8)
🔹 Goal: Understand how Gen AI works internally.
What are LLMs (Large Language Models)


Examples: GPT, BERT


Learn about Tokens, Parameters, Training, Inference


Embeddings


Convert text into numbers so machines understand meaning.


Transformers


Core concept behind GPT; attention-based learning



📍 Stage 4: Hands-On with Gen AI Tools (Weeks 9–11)
🔹 Goal: Build something using Gen AI.
OpenAI API / Gemini API


Generate text, build chatbots, summarizers, Q&A systems


Gradio / Streamlit


Build user-friendly UIs for Gen AI apps


LangChain (Optional but Valuable)


Framework to connect Gen AI models with tools like memory, search, database



📍 Stage 5: Real-World Use Cases (Week 12)
🔹 Goal: Understand how Gen AI is used in the industry.
Resume Builder with Gen AI


AI-Powered Study Notes Generator


PDF Q&A Chatbot


SQL Query Generator


Image-to-Text Converter



📍 Stage 6: Advance Topics ( Month 2 Onwards)
🔹 Goal: Go deep if you are serious about Gen AI career.
Agents vs Agentic AI


Agents: Perform tasks for users using LLMs (e.g., search and act)


Agentic AI: Multi-step decision making with autonomy


RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)


Combines external data + LLM to generate better, context-aware answers


MCP (Model Context Protocol)


Lets you define how different models/tools should interact with memory, tools, actions



📍 Stage 7: Build Portfolio Projects
Show what you’ve built — even small apps matter!
Chatbot with memory


AI Assistant for Students


Voice-based Q&A app


Code explanation tool
