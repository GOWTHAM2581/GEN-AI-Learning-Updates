Commercial Models (API Access)
These models are offered as managed services. They allow developers to integrate AI into their applications using API calls and SDKs (e.g., Python, Java, JavaScript). 
OpenAI: Offers models via API for various tasks.
GPT-4 / GPT-4o: Advanced large language models for text generation, reasoning, summarization, and code generation.
DALL-E 3: High-quality text-to-image generation model.
Sora / RunwayML: Models for high-quality text-to-video generation (Sora is not yet publicly available).
Google: Access to models is provided via Google AI Studio and the Vertex AI platform.
Gemini (Pro, Ultra, Nano): A family of multimodal models supporting vision, text, and code generation, with some versions optimized for on-device use (Nano).
Gemma: A family of lightweight, open models with the same research lineage as Gemini, available for customization and running in applications.
Imagen: Models for high-quality image generation and editing.
Anthropic: Develops reliable and safe AI models.
Claude: A conversational AI model for dialogue, summarization, and complex reasoning.
Microsoft Azure: Offers access to models (including OpenAI's) through Azure AI Foundry and the Azure OpenAI API, which integrates with other Azure services.
Amazon Web Services (AWS): Provides access to a range of foundation models via Amazon Bedrock, including their Titan family of models. 



Open-Source Models and Frameworks
Open-source options allow developers more control over the models, data privacy, and the ability to run models on their own hardware. 
Models:
Stable Diffusion (Stability AI): An open-source text-to-image model that is highly customizable and popular for creative applications and game development.
Llama (Meta): Open models for text generation and language tasks that can be fine-tuned.
Mistral AI Models: A corporate sponsor of open-source models known for high efficiency and strong coding capabilities.
Frameworks & Platforms:
Hugging Face: A hub for discovering, experimenting with, and deploying pre-trained open-source models for various tasks, including text generation and classification.
TensorFlow & PyTorch: Open-source machine learning libraries that provide tools for building, training, and deploying generative AI models.
GitHub Copilot (via API): An AI pair programmer that provides code suggestions and automation, available to developers via API and integrated into IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) like Visual Studio Code. 
Developers typically use these models for:
Generating boilerplate code or completing functions.
Automating documentation and test case generation.
Building AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants.
Creating images, videos, and audio for applications.
Summarizing documents and extracting insights from data
